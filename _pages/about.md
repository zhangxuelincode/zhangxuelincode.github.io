<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. candidate at College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, supervised by [Prof. Hong Chen](https://chenhongml.github.io/). Previously, I was persuing the M.S. degree with assistance of [Prof. Lingjuan Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lingjuan-Wu). I received the B.S. degree in Engineering from China Agricultural University in 2019. Recently, I have been conducting academic exchanges at Sun Yat-sen University.

My research interests lie in the areas of optimization and learning theory, with emphasis on the following topics:

- Automatic machine learning (e.g., Hyperparameter Optimization)

- Robust/Interpretable machine learning (e.g., Robust Metric, Sparse/Neural additive models)

- Applications on hardware Trojan detection (e.g., FPGA/Gate/LUT synthetic levels)

If you are interested or have any question on my works, please feel free to contact me: zhangxuelin@webmail.hzau.edu.cn

**IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2024 [C]**

- In this work, we propose a novel generalized additive model with a flexible link function automatically learned by a bilevel scheme. The proposed model is capable of nonlinear approximation, hidden interaction and feature selection, which also enjoys the theoretical guarantee of algorithmic convergence.

Hong Chen*, **Xuelin Zhang**, Tieliang Gong, Bin Gu, Feng Zheng. 

**Expert Systems With Applications 2024 [J]**

Peng Sima, Hao Deng*, **Xuelin Zhang**, Hong Chen. 

**International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 2024 [C]**

- This paper introduces a novel estimator that relies on an estimator of Value at Risk (VaR) and investigates the concentration inequalities in independent scenarios where the underlying distributions are sub-Gaussian, sub-exponential, or heavy-tailed, where the inequalities we derive are bilateral, exhibit exponential decay, and are not confined to bounded scenarios.

[Automated Hardware Trojan Detection at LUT Using Explainable Graph Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323915)

Lingjuan Wu, Hao Su, **Xuelin Zhang**, Yu Tai, Han Li, Wei Hu*. 

**International Conference on Computer-Aided Design 2023 [C]**

- In this work, we propose a novel hardware Trojan detection method based on graph neural networks (GNNs) targeting FPGA netlist. We leverage the rich explicit structural features and behavioral characteristics at LUT, which offers an ideal abstraction level and granularity for Trojan detection. A GNN model with optimized class-balanced focal loss is trained for automated Trojan feature extraction and classification.
